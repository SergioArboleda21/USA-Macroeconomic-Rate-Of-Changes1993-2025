Project: Analyzing the Phillips Curve in the Modern U.S. Economy
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project that investigates the validity of the classic economic trade-off between inflation and unemployment—the Phillips Curve—in the contemporary U.S. economy. The project was conceived to answer a critical question for the fictional Federal Economic Advisory Council (FEAC): Can policymakers still rely on this long-held theory to shape national economic strategy? 
This project demonstrates a full-cycle data analysis workflow, from defining the core business problem to delivering actionable recommendations based on empirical evidence.

Key Findings & Features:
Challenging a Classic Theory: The analysis of monthly U.S. economic data from 1993 to the present reveals that the traditional inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment is surprisingly weak, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of just -0.2165. This directly challenges the textbook Phillips Curve model. 
Decade-by-Decade Instability: The project uncovers that the relationship is not stable over time. While the 1990s and 2010s showed some semblance of the expected trade-off, the 2000s and 2020s defied it, with periods where both inflation and unemployment increased on average. 
Nuanced, Conditional Relationship: A deeper dive reveals that the trade-off is not entirely absent but appears only under specific conditions. In months with high inflation (CPI change > 0.5%), unemployment tended to fall; in months with low inflation, unemployment was more likely to rise. 
Actionable Policy Recommendations: The analysis culminates in a set of clear, data-driven recommendations for policymakers. These include de-emphasizing the Phillips Curve in policy modeling and developing a more holistic "Economic Health Dashboard" that incorporates a wider range of indicators. 
End-to-End Data Analysis Showcase: This repository follows the six phases of data analysis: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. It serves as a practical case study in using Python with the Pandas library for data verification and structuring , creating compelling visualizations to communicate findings , and translating complex analytical insights into strategic actions. 

This project is a strong example of how data analytics can be used to scrutinize established theories and provide a clear, evidence-based foundation for high-stakes decision-making. The methodologies and conclusions presented here are designed to be clear and impactful for both technical and executive audiences.
