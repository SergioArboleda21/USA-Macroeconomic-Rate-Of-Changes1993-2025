This repository contains a full data analysis case study that decodes the classic economic trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
Goal: To determine if the Phillips Curve is a reliable model for policymakers in the modern economic landscape.
Methodology: The project uses Python, primarily the Pandas library, to process, analyze, and visualize monthly U.S. macroeconomic data (macro_monthly.csv).
Key Finding: The analysis concludes that there is no longer a simple, stable, or reliable trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The classic model is shown to be an outdated and potentially misleading tool for making national economic policy.
